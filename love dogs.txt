This is a file about how much I love dogs

I have two dogs: Bennie and Magi

Bennie is a French Bull Dog

Magi is a Cocker Spaniel

Bennie is an asshole, while Magi is the sweet one

But sometimes Magi can be very fiesty when it comes to small girl dogs

I want to get another dog

but three is a crowd

I consider myself a crazy dog mom and I am proud of it 

Reasons why I am a crazy dog mom, I take my dogs to see Santa every holiday season

I am strongly considering getting a dog stroller

I even put it on my wish list for christmas

but I think my boyfriend and family ignored it for the sake of my social life

I will order one anyways, since no one can stop me
