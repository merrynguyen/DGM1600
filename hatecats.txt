I hate cats but some of them can be cute

In all reality I think they are the devil too, 

because what kind of non-devil creature makes the noises that they make?

Cats are never excited to see you, and they are selfish buttholes

So why do people like them?

I subconsiously but consiously, judge people who love them.
